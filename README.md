A CRD project made in 2 days using gorest API with Axios, React, and SCSS.
☑ I built a web app using GO REST Post Model.
☑ The web app can do the CRD functions on Post Model. There is NO "Update" feature because of time constraint due to being busy with FYP and other assignments.
☑ I was also able to handle the response callback if the response return errors or fail validation.
☑ The web app has pagination when getting all posts. There is NO "Filters" feature since there is nothing to filter as of now.
☑ The web app is responsive.
☑  Project progress is tracked using GitHub.
☑ Used React as the front-end framework.
